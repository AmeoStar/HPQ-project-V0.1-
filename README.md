# HPQ-project-V0.3-

Project is still in development - floor 1, 2-1,2-2, and 2-3 are content complete. Floor 3 is in early development and doesn't have any enemies or items. Some features such as respawning are temporary and obviously overpowered, some balancing changes need to be made to weapons, enemies and the like. If anyone reading this is able to comment on how I can improve this code or balancing, it would be much appreciated.
