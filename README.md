# HPQ-project-V0.1-
for first wave playtesting

information for anyone I sent this to:
  this game is obviously not finished, with content complete up to 2-1 (excluding some item and spell functionality), limited functionality for 2-2, and no further stages as of yet
  please do either add comments if possible on this site or in person to tell me what you would want changed, what is confusing, or what could be communicated and balanced better.
  this is mainly for making the general playthrough experience better rather than adding new content, but if you have any ideas do say them
  thanks for looking over this, its v helpful for me and the project.
