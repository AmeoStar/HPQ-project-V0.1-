# HPQ-project-V0.2-

information for anyone I sent this to:
  this game is obviously not finished, with content complete up to 2-2 , and an overworld and items for 2-3 with no combat yet.
  please do either add comments if possible on this site or in person to tell me what you would want changed, what is confusing, or what could be communicated and balanced better.
  this is mainly for making the general playthrough experience better rather than adding new content, but if you have any ideas do say them
  thanks for looking over this, its v helpful for me and the project.
